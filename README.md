## 🧬 About Parkinson's Disease
Parkinson's Disease is a **neurodegenerative disorder** that affects movement and worsens over time. It is primarily characterized by tremors, stiffness, and difficulty with balance and coordination. This condition is caused by the gradual breakdown of dopamine-producing neurons in the brain. Early detection of Parkinson's can significantly improve quality of life by allowing for early intervention and better management of symptoms.

### Key Symptoms:
- Tremors (shaking)
- Rigidity (stiff muscles)
- Bradykinesia (slowness of movement)
- Impaired balance and coordination

## 🌐 Project Summary
This project leverages **Machine Learning** to detect **Parkinson's Disease** by analyzing vocal features. Using a variety of models, we aim to identify patterns in voice data that indicate early symptoms of Parkinson's.

---

## 📋 Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Accessed via a reputable source.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned, normalized, and prepared for model training.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncovered trends and relationships in vocal features.
4. **Balancing & Scaling**: Ensured data is balanced and features are appropriately scaled.
5. **Model Training & Evaluation**: Tested various models to find the most effective one.

Several algorithms were trained and evaluated to find the best fit for our data:
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **XGBoost**

## 🎖️ Best Model Performance
The **Random Forest Classifier** achieved the highest performance:
- **Accuracy:** 99.6%
- **F1 Score:** 0.961
- **R² Score:** 0.862  

These metrics reflect the model's effectiveness in detecting Parkinson's indicators from vocal features.
